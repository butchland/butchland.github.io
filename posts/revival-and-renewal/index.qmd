This is my umpteenth time to refresh my blog (or rather, *revive* -- its been dead for the last two years). 

![](sunrise.jpg)


This time using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). 

Let's see -- in the past I've used Jekyll (sometime until 2015) and Hugo (until recently). 

I like it, its simple but still has enough features to match many blog site apps.

As for the image, guess what: it's from [Stable Diffusion Web](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo), using this prompt "sunrise, dawn of a new age, hyperrealistic, horizon, photorealism"
