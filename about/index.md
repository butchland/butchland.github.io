I am a programmer by heart.

Whence I came, know me by how I speak -- for there is only one programmer's language, and all others are but a dialect of it:

I started, professionally speaking, with a something called dBase III, then I cobbled with Cobol, and got my kicks with CICS -- but that was a long long time ago.

I learned my C from a book by K and R, and got enough rope not to shoot myself in the foot with C plus plus from the Allen's Berkeley class.

Back then, I wanted to be cool, so I got hot with Java.

And then I found the light, and it was with a comedy troupe named Monty Python -- for a while
there, I did the dope with Zope. (I know that doesn't rhyme, but those in the know, know why)

I learned the good parts of Javascript from Doug's book.

I also learned to be agile from a guy named Bas.

But now, in 2015, I learned to speak in R and went nuts with go.

There are some argot I know well: SQL and Unix.

I know how to Spring from Java and be enterprising with java beans.

I'm also mobile with Android and can do DI with dagger. 

There are others I speak, but with an accent: C, PHP, and Scheme.

I can paint pages with HTML and CSS, with a dash of Bootstrap, but maybe others are better at it.

There are some I can read, but not speak well: C#, C++, Lua, Ruby, Scala and their ilk.

Thats it for me, there may be lots of others not here, but I can learn them, if need be.
