I'm rebooting my blog because its easier to get inspired by starting afresh than reviving a long-dead [one](http://memesplicer.blogspot.com/). 

Here are my other reasons:

### I need to share *more*. 

On the web, I have always been more of a consumer rather than a collaborator (Athough I've done some opensource work in the past so I'm *not* entirely averse to collaboration).

I hope to change that in the days to come.

### I need to not be afraid of *failure* and *rejection*.

> *Perfect is the enemy of good.* 

(I heard that from [somewhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)).

One reason that has stopped me from sharing what I wrote has always been the fear that my writing is nowhere near being good enough.

Good or bad, I am forcing myself to overcome that fear, and  share whatever I have.
 
###I need to document my ideas.

Oh I have lots of ideas. My problem has never been running out of ideas. Its always been remembering, evaluating and following through with the good ones that's been my problem.

By writing them out, I am playing a mind trick with myself to force me to deal with them.

###I need to become a better writer.

By blogging, I hope that my writing becomes a habit. This blog is my way of developing the discipline of writing.

Last, maybe I can get feedback and engagement.

But even if nobody reads my blog,  I'll be content if I can just fill it with fresh content (See how clever that was? -- I'm awesome! ;))

*PS. I've been reading [Andy Weir's **The Martian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29) and I think I'm channeling Mark Watney right now.*

*PPS. Fantastic book that one. Specially recommended for space nerds everywhere.*
